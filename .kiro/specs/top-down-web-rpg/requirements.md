# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a story-focused top-down web RPG game. The game will be a browser-based role-playing game featuring a top-down perspective where players control a pre-designed main character through an engaging narrative. Players will explore the game world, experience story content, acquire powers through story progression, manage inventory items, and engage in occasional combat encounters. The primary focus is on storytelling and character development rather than combat mechanics.
